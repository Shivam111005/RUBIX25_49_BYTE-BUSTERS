TEAM NAME: BYTE BUSTERS
TEAM MEMBERS: ANIMESH,ASMIT,PRATHAM,SHIVAM
TOPIC : Food Rescue Platform
Project Overview:
The Food Rescue Platform is a web-based solution aimed at tackling food wastage and hunger by connecting food donors (e.g., restaurants, households, suppliers) 
with recipients (e.g., shelters, food banks, charities). It fosters community collaboration to rescue surplus food, reduce waste, and provide nutritious meals 
to those in need. By leveraging technology, the platform enables efficient coordination of food donations and promotes sustainable practices to combat food 
insecurity.

Key Features:

1. Donor & Recipient Registration
A simple registration process for food donors and recipients, making it easy for both parties to connect and participate in food rescue efforts.

2. Food Listing & Availability
Donors can list available food in real-time, including descriptions, quantities, and expiration dates. Recipients can search and filter donations based on 
location, food type, and urgency.


4. Pickup & Delivery Coordination
Integration of logistics to facilitate the pickup and delivery of donations through volunteers or partnerships with delivery services, ensuring timely and 
efficient food distribution.


5. Verification & Safety Guidelines
A robust system to ensure food quality and safety, providing clear guidelines on expiration checks, proper packaging, and safe food handling practices.


6. Impact Tracker & Reporting
A dashboard showcasing key metrics such as the total food rescued, recipients served, and the environmental and social impact of the platform, fostering 
transparency and motivation among users.


7. Volunteer Opportunities
A feature that allows users to volunteer in food rescue operations, such as food pickup, delivery, or sorting at recipient locations, promoting active 
community participation.



Purpose and Vision:

This platform aims to address two critical global challenges: food wastage and hunger. By facilitating the efficient redistribution of surplus food, it 
reduces waste and helps nourish those in need. The project embodies sustainability, community involvement, and the spirit of giving, ensuring that no 
edible food goes to waste while helping vulnerable populations.

Technical Highlights:

Developed as a responsive webpage with user-friendly interfaces for donors, recipients, and volunteers.

Real-time food listing and availability tracking.
